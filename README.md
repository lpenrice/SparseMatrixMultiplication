# SparseMatrixMultiplication
Our goal was to see if we could build our own sparse matrix multiplication method that would perform better than a naive one to show the benefits of sparse matrices on a page rank implementation. This was succesful, although the built in matrix multiplication methods performed significantly better than ours, their big O was the same as ours. The analysis.ipynb file displays our experiment.
